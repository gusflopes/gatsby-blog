**Hello Devs, welcome!**

### Intro
I'm just starting this blog to post articles and news about my carrer on Software Development.

I'm a lawyer and accountant from Brazil, but my passion always were Technology and Development. I started using DOS, Windows, learned a few things about hardware and when I was a kid I loved to try new things (*like installing a 56kbps modem on a 386 not really knowing what I was doing...* ).

I did some homepages using `HTML` and other programs/technologies like `Macromedia Dreamweaver`, `Flash Creator`... Not sure if the names are right... It was so long ago.

My contact with programming language was making trivial stuff like `Scripts for mIRC`, static pages web development and, eventually, making some cooler stuff like scripts for bots (`Diablo II`, `Ultima Online`).

###  First Jobs (*missing tech...*)

Eventually when I graduated from High Shcool i went to Law School here in Brazil, and started working with that. First as internship and eventually as a Lawyer.

I always tried to use my tech knowledges to build things that could help me on my work, like a simple Task Scheduler on Access to handle our legal deadlines (*currently there is more then 80k registers and the database  is still running...*).

But the most fun I had was when I was restructuring a Department that handled with paying civil convictions (*I was managing a team with about 18 ppl and diferent roles and my task was to make sure we could comply with the deadlines*).

For this I worked with the IT Director of the lawfirm so we  could automate the process of scheduling tasks and preventing nonconformities. I was kind of the *Product Owner* and he was the  *Developer Team*, even I didn't know those terms at the time.

Eventually I built an Access solution, connected to our SQL Server, and our  Project finally started working. When I leave this job I left the system working and trained a few guys to replace me.

That small feature eventually was implemented within the ERP we used and, last time i checked, it was working until now.

### Small Partner and new challenges (*missing tech even more...*)
When I left that job was to come back to the lawfirm where I did my internship, but now I was a small partner, but on a smaller lawfirm that I used to work.

There was no technology department so the only thigs I really developed this time was small things I could use myself.

Eventually I was starting to focus more and more on Tax Law (*I have a postgraduate degree on Tax Law*) and things were happening on this field, until I finally took a second degree on Accouting.

When I graduated from Accouting I was already working with Tax Advisory, and working mostly as a Consultant Lawyer then a Litigation Lawyer.

### New business - Account firm
Just as I graduated from Accounting I started a small accounting firm mostly for my clients from Tax and Legal Advisory, but I just got in love with this area.

To be honest, that was not really all about the Accouting, but about the disruptive changes happening on the fields.

Other countries like Autralia and the United States are already going through this for a longer time, but in Brazil, the technological revolution is still in its early stages.

Automated tasks, cloud bookkeeping, remote working, new technologies changing the way things were made (*Image Recognition and OCR on documents and statements, machine learning, and much more...*).

Finally, I realized that what made me fall in love with Accounting was actually technology.

### Coming back home!

Now is 2019: Time to plan some big career changes!

I still have my accounting firm but I'm learning and trying to swift my carrer to work with development.

Made a bunch of courses (*Git, C#, Python, Web Development, HTML5,CSS3, Javascript, Node.js, React*) and now I am starting to focus on the Javascript stack: **Node.js, React and React Native**.

It is still early to make a big decision, but for now I'm thinking on moving to another country (*like USA or Canada*), or working here in Brazil.

If I end up here, I'll probably look for working with some startup or company whose goal is to disrupt bussiness processes, but I'll probably revisit this thinking later.

###Thanks!

Thanks for reading this. Next posts I'll start to write more about technology and my journey becoming a Full Stack Webdeveloper or something else.
